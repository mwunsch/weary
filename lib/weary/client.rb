  # An abstract class used to construct client libraries and the primary
  # entrance point to use the Weary framework. Client defines a DSL to describe
  # and construct a set of Resources, which in turn can generate Requests that
  # can perform HTTP actions.
  #
  # Resources are defined and stored by one of the class methods corresponding
  # to an HTTP request method. Every Resource is declared with a name that
  # acts as both a key to access the resource, and, when the class is
  # instantiated, the name of a dynamically generated instance method.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   class GiltSales < Weary::Client
  #     domain "https://api.gilt.com/v1"
  #
  #     required :apikey
  #
  #     optional :affid
  #
  #     get :active, "/sales/active.json"
  #
  #     get :active_in_store, "/sales/:store/active.json"
  #
  #     get :upcoming, "/sales/upcoming.json"
  #
  #     get :upcoming_in_store, "/sales/:store/upcoming.json"
  #
  #     get :detail, "/sales/:store/:sale_key/detail.json"
  #   end
  #
  #   sales = GiltSales.new
  #   sales.active_in_store :store => :women, :apikey => "my-key"
  #   # => A Weary::Request object
